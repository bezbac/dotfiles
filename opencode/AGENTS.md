# Code Philosophy

- Simple over complex. Explicit over implicit.
- Composition > inheritance.
- Make impossible states impossible.
- Don’t abstract until the third use.
- Prefer obvious code over comments which explain code. DO use comments for elaborating reasoning, shortcomings and possible future improvements.
